                <p>If Hick’s Law is all about eliminating distractions, I can hardly think of any website that does that better than Zillow. Front and center on their homepage is the search bar prompting an address. The area around the search bar I would classify as white space. It’s just a background picture and a one line tag. All navigation cues are located in the small hamburger in the left hand corner. For other options you have to scroll down below the first screen to see the other services that zillow offers. They virtually eliminate all but one choice with the homepage.</p>

                    <h2>White Space</h2>
                    <h3>Apple</h3>
                    <a href="https://www.apple.com/?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_547597405561_pgrid_13945964887_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-">apple.com</a>

                <img src="images/appleHome.jpg" alt="Apple Homepage-Demonstrates White space ">
                <p>Apple has always been known for its sleek modern design, and I think that extends to their website. The navigation and company logo is in a discrete bar at the top of the page. The rest of the page consists of the title and button elements, and the image at bottom of the page. There is an appropriate amount of white space between the title and the photo to separate them, but because they are the only two things on the page they don’t lose the sense of connection. I think that this very simple design is able to connect two elements while feeling very clean and modern.</p>

                    <h2>Repetition</h2>
                    <h3>Etsy</h3>
                    <a href="https://www.etsy.com/">etsy.com</a>

                <img src="images/etsyHome.jpg" alt="Etsy Homepage- Demonstrates repetition">
                <p>In the Etsy website I love the repetitive use of the circle for the featured category navigation. Because Etsy is an online marketplace, there is a need to connect many different featured sales categories. Because of this there is a need to unite these categories in one cohesive website. Using the circle pictures as the repetitive element cleans and simplifies the design and connects categories that might not always have clear connections. </p>
